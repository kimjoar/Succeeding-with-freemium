\chapter{Theory}
\label{chapter:theory}

This chapter is meant to give a better understanding of the problem from a theoretical perspective. To understand freemium in relation to business models, how it works and its implications, we must first understand what business models are, how they work and what they imply. Thus, this section starts with a brief review of the literature concerning the business model concept and a related framework. Subsequently, two central aspects of freemium is discussed, information goods and free. The concept of information goods is explained to build a better understanding of digitized products and services, while we discuss free to better understand the implications of giving away a product or service gratis. The chapter concludes with important implications from the theory.
