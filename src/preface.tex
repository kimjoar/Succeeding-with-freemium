\chapter*{Preface}

This work on \emph{freemium} is part of my specialization project at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (\abbr{NTNU}). My specialization is in the field of innovation and entrepreneurship at the Department of Industrial Economics and Technology Management (\abbr{IØT}), faculty of Social Science and Technology Management (\abbr{SVT}).

I would like to thank my supervisor, adjunct professor Karl Klingsheim, for interesting discussions and ideas throughout the process. I would also like to thank fellow student Andreas Parr Bjørnsund, who has also written a project on business models and who I have shared resources and articles with during the writing of this project. Lastly, I want to thank my good friends Christian Magnus Skoglund, Olav Bjørkøy and Vetle Engesbak for their great feedback and interesting discussions from the very beginning to the very end of this process.
